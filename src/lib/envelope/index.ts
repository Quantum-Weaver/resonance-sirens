// the-envelope — the sovereignty trio as one library.
//
// RE-HOMED (never extracted) from resonance-echoes settings (the envelope
// law, B4–B6, "this shape is the family's to inherit") with Compass's
// second implementation read beside it, 2026-07-30, per KP's law: "the
// rehoming should not mean extracting" — both apps keep their organs
// untouched. This library carries the LAW, framework-free, so every app
// in the family can reference one truth instead of re-deriving it.
//
// The three laws, carried verbatim from the origins' own comments:
//  1. EXPORT: one versioned envelope, schema-versioned, app-namespaced —
//     "the counts are written on the envelope so a vessel can see at a
//     glance that the file carries what the app shows."
//  2. PURGE: "the export must be complete IN HAND before anything
//     deletes — export-then-purge may never destroy the remainder." And
//     purge clears everything, never a curated list — "future keys must
//     not survive a purge by omission."
//  3. IMPORT: non-destructive by law — "an existing definition is the
//     vessel's current mind and is never overwritten by an older file."
//     Legacy bare exports stay honored: "a vessel's old backup must
//     never be told it's worthless." Wrong-app envelopes are refused
//     plainly.
